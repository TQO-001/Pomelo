Here’s a suggested file structure for your **Invoice & Subscription Billing App** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will keep things clean and organized as you add more features.

```
invoice-billing-app/
├── assets/
│   ├── css/                    # Stylesheets
│   │   └── main.css            # Main CSS file
│   ├── images/                 # Images (logo, icons, etc.)
│   └── js/                     # JavaScript files
│       └── app.js              # Main JS file for app functionality
├── components/                 # Reusable components (like headers, footers)
│   ├── invoice-form.html       # Form for creating invoices
│   └── subscription-form.html  # Form for managing subscriptions
├── data/                       # Temporary data storage (JSON files)
│   └── invoices.json           # Store invoice data (can be replaced with a DB later)
├── index.html                  # Homepage of the app
├── invoice.html                # Invoice details page
├── subscription.html           # Subscription management page
└── README.md                   # Project README file
```

### Explanation of Key Folders:

- **assets/**
    
    - `css/`: Contains all the styles for your app, e.g., the main stylesheet (`main.css`).
    - `images/`: For storing image assets like logos, icons, or any other graphical elements.
    - `js/`: This folder contains all JavaScript functionality. `app.js` is where you will define the logic for invoice creation, subscription management, etc.

- **components/**
    
    - This folder holds the HTML snippets that are used across your app. These can be modular components like the invoice form, subscription form, or others that are reused on different pages.

- **data/**
    
    - For now, you can use this folder to store temporary JSON files like `invoices.json` to keep track of your data locally before connecting to a database.

- **index.html**: This will be the landing page or homepage of your app.
- **invoice.html**: Used for displaying detailed information about individual invoices.
- **subscription.html**: A page for managing subscriptions, including adding, editing, and deleting subscriptions.

This file structure will help keep your codebase organized and scalable as you add more features to your app.
